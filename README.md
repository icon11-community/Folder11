## Contributing Guidelines

Folder11 is just awesome because of your contributions. Your contributions are greatly appreciated, but you must follow this contributing guidelines.

### Icon Specification

We provided svg, ai, and fig template to make it easier. The specifications include the following:

- We do not oblige to use specific vector program.
- Icon must be svg formated vector.
- Icon should not have embedded raster image.
- You should not replace existing icon.
- Canvas have 1:1 ratio.
- Assuming the canvas is 256px height, then the margins are as follows:
  - Left margin is 17px (0.06640625vh).
  - Right margin is 15px (0.05859375vh).
  - Bottom margin is 46px (0.1796875vh).
  - Top margin for "back" is 34px (0.1328125vh).
  - Top margin for "front" is 62px (0.2421875vh).

### File Naming

- File name is starts with icon name and ends with variant number, -- separated with dash.
- Name of the icon must be written in snake case.
- Because of we should not replace existing icon, new icon must be numbered that starts with 1.
- First icon must be not numbered.
- If an icon variant for an existing icon is created it's maximum size in pixel - seperated with a dash, after potential numbering - is appended. The size must be followed by the unit shorthand 'px'.
